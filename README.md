# Employment Analysis in India – Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA)

This project performs an in-depth Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) on a messy employment dataset from India to uncover patterns related to **salary, education, industry, experience, and AI risk**.

The goal of this project is to clean the dataset, explore trends using visualizations, and extract meaningful insights that reflect real-world employment scenarios.

## Project Overview

Employment data often contains inconsistencies, missing values, and mixed data types.  
This project focuses on handling such messy data and performing structured EDA to answer key questions like:

- How does salary vary across industries?
- What is the relationship between experience and income?
- How does education level impact salary?
- Which industries face higher AI automation risk?

##  Objectives

- Perform data cleaning and preprocessing
- Conduct **univariate, bivariate, and multivariate analysis**
- Use statistical summaries to support insights
- Visualize trends using effective plots
- Present findings in a clear and interpretable manner
